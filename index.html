                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,[18][19] with internal convective motion 
                that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.[20] It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 
                1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 
                99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[21] Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium 
                (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

                </p>
                <ul class="d-none d-sm-block">
                <li><b>Core </b>  - the innermost 20–25% of the Sun's radius, where temperature (energies) and pressure are 
                sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur. Hydrogen fuses into helium (which cannot currently be fused at this 
                point in the Sun's life). The fusion process releases energy, and the helium gradually accumulates to form an 
                inner core of helium within the core itself.</li>
                <li><b>Radiative zone  </b>  - Convection cannot occur until much nearer the surface of the Sun. Therefore, 
                between about 20–25% of the radius, and 70% of the radius, there is a "radiative zone" in which energy transfer 
                occurs by means of radiation (photons) rather than by convection.</li>
               <li><b>Tachocline  </b>  -  the boundary region between the radiative and convective zones.</li>
                <li><b>Convective zone </b>  - Between about 70% of the Sun's radius and a point close to the visible surface, 
                the Sun is cool and diffuse enough for convection to occur, and this becomes the primary means of outward heat 
                transfer, similar to weather cells which form in the earth's atmosphere</li>
                <li><b>Photosphere </b>  - the deepest part of the Sun which we can directly observe with visible light. Because 
                the Sun is a gaseous object, it does not have a clearly defined surface; its visible parts are usually divided 
                into a 'photosphere' and 'atmosphere'.</li>
                <li><b>Atmosphere </b>  - a gaseous 'halo' surrounding the Sun, comprising the chromosphere, solar transition 
                region, corona and heliosphere. These can be seen when the main part of the Sun is hidden, for example, during 
                a solar eclipse.</li>

              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being only 
              larger than Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as 
              the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, 
              which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
               Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact 
               craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
              The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the 
              tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus 
              Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System and of Valles 
              Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern 
              hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, 
              Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar 
              to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

                      <ul class="d-none d-sm-block">
                      Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas 
                      giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the 
                      other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible 
                      to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before 
                      recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[18] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter
                       can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[19] and is on average the 
                       third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
                      Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though 
                      helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core 
                      of heavier elements,[20] but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid 
                      surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid 
                      (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly 
                      segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along 
                      their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is 
                      known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. 
                      Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has 
                      79 known moons,[21] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. 
                      Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
                      Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the 
                      planet on December 4, 1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma in Jupiter's magnetic field and also 
                      found that Jupiter's magnetic tail was nearly 800 million kilometers long, covering the entire 
                      distance to Saturn.[22] Jupiter has been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, 
                      beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo 
                      orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995.[23] In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the 
                      New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en 
                      route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around 
                      Jupiter on July 4, 2016.[24][25] Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include 
                      the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.
