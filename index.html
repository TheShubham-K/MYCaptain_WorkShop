                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion 
                that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 
                1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 
                99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium 
                (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
                The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally 
                and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). 
                It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][23] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within
                 a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened
                into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it 
                eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
                The Sun currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million 
                tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 
                years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core 
                has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo 
                a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun 
                into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits 
                of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. After this, it 
                will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer 
                produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.

                <ul class="d-none d-sm-block" id="strPara">
                <li><b>Core </b>  - the innermost 20–25% of the Sun's radius, where temperature (energies) and pressure are 
                sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur. Hydrogen fuses into helium (which cannot currently be fused at this 
                point in the Sun's life). The fusion process releases energy, and the helium gradually accumulates to form an 
                inner core of helium within the core itself.</li>
                <li><b>Radiative zone  </b>  - Convection cannot occur until much nearer the surface of the Sun. Therefore, 
                between about 20–25% of the radius, and 70% of the radius, there is a "radiative zone" in which energy transfer 
                occurs by means of radiation (photons) rather than by convection.</li>
               <li><b>Tachocline  </b>  -  the boundary region between the radiative and convective zones.</li>
                <li><b>Convective zone </b>  - Between about 70% of the Sun's radius and a point close to the visible surface, 
                the Sun is cool and diffuse enough for convection to occur, and this becomes the primary means of outward heat 
                transfer, similar to weather cells which form in the earth's atmosphere</li>
                <li><b>Photosphere </b>  - the deepest part of the Sun which we can directly observe with visible light. Because 
                the Sun is a gaseous object, it does not have a clearly defined surface; its visible parts are usually divided 
                into a 'photosphere' and 'atmosphere'.</li>
                <li><b>Atmosphere </b>  - a gaseous 'halo' surrounding the Sun, comprising the chromosphere, solar transition 
                region, corona and heliosphere. These can be seen when the main part of the Sun is hidden, for example, during 
                a solar eclipse.</li>

              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being only 
              larger than Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as 
              the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, 
              which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
               Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact 
               craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
              The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the 
              tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus 
              Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System and of Valles 
              Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern 
              hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, 
              Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar 
              to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
              Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the 
              similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice 
              those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two
              Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about −143 °C (−225 °F) at the winter
              polar caps to highs of up to 35 °C (95 °F) in equatorial summer. The wide range in temperatures 
              is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure, and the
              low thermal inertia of Martian soil. The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting 
              in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.
              If Mars had an Earth-like orbit, its seasons would be similar to Earth's because its axial tilt is 
              similar to Earth's. The comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect.
              Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north, and near 
              aphelion when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and summer in the north. As a result, the seasons 
              in the southern hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would 
              otherwise be the case. The summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer 
              temperatures in the north by up to 30 °C (54 °F).

                      Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas 
                      giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the 
                      other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible 
                      to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before 
                      recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter
                       can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is on average the 
                       third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
                      Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though 
                      helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core 
                      of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid 
                      surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid 
                      (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly 
                      segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along 
                      their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is 
                      known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. 
                      Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has 
                      79 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. 
                      Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
                      Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the 
                      planet on December 4, 1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma in Jupiter's magnetic field and also 
                      found that Jupiter's magnetic tail was nearly 800 million kilometers long, covering the entire 
                      distance to Saturn. Jupiter has been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, 
                      beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo 
                      orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the 
                      New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en 
                      route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around 
                      Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include 
                      the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.

                happens, it will have become a white dwarf.</li>
                <li><b>The temperature inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius.</b><br>Energy is 
                generated at the Sun’s core, by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Hot objects expand, 
                the Sun would explode if it were not for its enormous gravitational force. The temperature on the 
                surface of the Sun is closer to 5,600 degrees Celsius.</li>
                <li><b>Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth.</b><br>The Sun is an average distance 
                of 150 million kilometres from the Earth. Light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second. Dividing 
                one by the other gives us an approximate time of 500 seconds (or eight minutes and 20 seconds). 
                Although this energy reaches Earth in a few minutes, it will already have taken millions of years 
                to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun travels at 220 kilometres per second.</b><br>The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years 
                from the galactic centre. It takes the Sun 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the 
                centre of the <a href="https://space-facts.com/galaxies/milky-way/">Milky Way</a>.</li>
                <li><b>The distance from the Sun to Earth changes throughout the year.</b><br>This is because the 
                Earth travels on an 
                elliptical orbit around the Sun. The distance between the two bodies varies from 147 to 152 million
                 kilometres.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun is middle-aged.</b><br>At around 4.6 billion years old, the Sun has already burned 
                off about half of its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for 
                approximately 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf.</li>     
                <li><b>The Sun has a very strong magnetic field.</b><br>Magnetic energy released by the Sun during 
                magnetic storms causes solar flares. We see these as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines 
                twist and they spin, much like a tornado would on Earth.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun generates solar wind.</b><br>The wind is a stream of charged particles. This travels 
                at approximately 450 kilometres per second through the solar system. Solar wind occurs when the

               <p><b style="color: orange;">Mars</b> size compared to <b style="color: rgba(128, 255, 0, 0.808);">Earth</b></p>


                <li><b>Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass.</b><br>Even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume 
                and just over 10% of the Earth’s mass, around two thirds of the <a href="https://space-facts.com/earth/">Earth’s</a> surface is covered in water. 
                Martian surface 
                gravity is only 37% of the Earth’s (meaning you could leap nearly three times higher on Mars).</li>
                <li><b>Mars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar system.</b> <br> <a href="https://space-facts.com/mars-features/#olympus">Olympus Mons</a>, a shield volcano, is 21km high 
                and 600km in diameter. Despite having formed over billions of years, evidence from volcanic lava flows is so recent many 
                scientists believe it could still be active.</li>
                <li><b>Only 18 missions to Mars have been successful.</b><br>As of September 2014 there have been 40 <a href="https://space-facts.com/mars-missions/">missions to Mars</a>, including orbiters, landers and rovers but not counting flybys. The most recent arrivals include the Mars Curiosity mission in 2012, the MAVEN mission, which arrived on September 22, 2014, followed by the Indian Space Research Organization’s MOM Mangalyaan orbiter, which arrived on September 24, 2014. The next missions to arrive will be the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, comprising an orbiter, lander, and a rover, followed by NASA’s InSight robotic lander mission, slated for launch in March 2016 and a planned arrival in September, 2016.</li>
                <li><b>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system.</b><br> They can last for months and cover the entire planet. The seasons are extreme because its elliptical (oval-shaped) orbital path around the Sun is more elongated than most other planets in the <a href="https://space-facts.com/solar-system/">solar system</a>.</li>
                <li><b>On Mars the Sun appears about half the size as it does on Earth.</b><br>At the closest point to the Sun, the Martian southern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a short, intensely hot summer, while the northern hemisphere endures a brief, cold winter: at its farthest point from the Sun, the Martian northern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere endures a lengthy, cold winter.</li>
                <li><b>Pieces of Mars have fallen to Earth.</b><br>Scientists have found tiny traces of Martian atmosphere within meteorites violently ejected from Mars, then orbiting the solar system amongst galactic debris for millions of years, before crash landing on Earth. This allowed scientists to begin studying Mars prior to launching space missions.</li>
                <li><b>Mars takes its name from the Roman god of war.</b><br>The ancient Greeks called the planet Ares, after their god of war; the Romans then did likewise, associating the planet’s blood-red colour with Mars, their own god of war. Interestingly, other ancient cultures also focused on colour – to China’s astronomers it was ‘the fire star’, whilst Egyptian priests called on ‘Her Desher’, or ‘the red one’. The red colour Mars is known for is due to the rock and dust covering its surface being rich in iron.</li>
                <li><b>There are signs of liquid water on Mars.</b><br>For years Mars has been known to have water in the form of ice. The first signs of trickling water are dark stripes or stains on crater wall and cliffs seen in satellite images. Due to Mars’ atmosphere this water would have to be salty to prevent it from freezing or vaporising.</li>
                <li><b>One day Mars will have a ring.</b><br>In the next 20-40 million years Mars’ largest moon Phobos will be torn apart by gravitational forces leading to the creation of a ring that could last up to 100 million years.</li>
                <li><b>Sunsets on Mars are blue.</b><br>During the martian day the sky is pinkish-red, this is the opposite of the Earth’s skies.</li>

                <li><b>The Sun is all the colours mixed together, this appears white to our eyes.</b></li>
                <li><b>The Sun is composed of hydrogen (70%) and Helium (28%).</b></li>
                <li><b>The Sun is a main-sequence G2V star (or Yellow Dwarf).</b> </li>
                <li><b>The Sun is 109 times wider than the Earth and 330,000 times as massive.</b> </li>
                <li><b>The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</b> </li>
                <li><b>The distance between the Earth and the Sun is an Astronomical Unit (AU)</b> </li>
                <li><b>One million Earths could fit inside the Sun.</b> <br> A hollow Sun would fit around 960,000 
                spherical Earths. If squished inside with no wasted space, then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. 
                The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System.</b><br>The mass of the Sun is 
                approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, 
                whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere.</b><br> There is a 10-kilometre difference between the Sun’s polar 
                and equatorial diameter. This means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in 
                nature.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun will consume the Earth.</b><br>When the Sun has burned all its Hydrogen, it will 
                continue to burn helium for 130 million more years. During this time, it will expand to the point 
                that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and the Earth. At this stage it will have become a red giant</li>

                <li><b>One million Earths could fit inside the Sun.</b> <br> A hollow Sun would fit around 960,000 
                spherical Earths. If squished inside with no wasted space, then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. 
                The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System.</b><br>The mass of the Sun is 
                approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, 
                whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere.</b><br> There is a 10-kilometre difference between the Sun’s polar 
                and equatorial diameter. This means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in 
                nature.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun will consume the Earth.</b><br>When the Sun has burned all its Hydrogen, it will 
                continue to burn helium for 130 million more years. During this time, it will expand to the point 
                that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and the Earth. At this stage it will have become a red giant</li>
                <li><b>The Sun will one day be about the size of Earth.</b><br>After its red giant phase, the Sun 
                will collapse. It will keep its enormous mass with the approximate volume of our planet. When this 
                happens, it will have become a white dwarf.</li>
                <li><b>The temperature inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius.</b><br>Energy is 
                generated at the Sun’s core, by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Hot objects expand, 
                the Sun would explode if it were not for its enormous gravitational force. The temperature on the 
                surface of the Sun is closer to 5,600 degrees Celsius.</li>
                <li><b>Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth.</b><br>The Sun is an average distance 
                of 150 million kilometres from the Earth. Light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second. Dividing 
                one by the other gives us an approximate time of 500 seconds (or eight minutes and 20 seconds). 
                Although this energy reaches Earth in a few minutes, it will already have taken millions of years 
                to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun travels at 220 kilometres per second.</b><br>The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years 
                from the galactic centre. It takes the Sun 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the 
                centre of the <a href="https://space-facts.com/galaxies/milky-way/">Milky Way</a>.</li>
                <li><b>The distance from the Sun to Earth changes throughout the year.</b><br>This is because the 
                Earth travels on an 
                elliptical orbit around the Sun. The distance between the two bodies varies from 147 to 152 million
                 kilometres.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun is middle-aged.</b><br>At around 4.6 billion years old, the Sun has already burned 
                off about half of its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for 
                approximately 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf.</li>     
                <li><b>The Sun has a very strong magnetic field.</b><br>Magnetic energy released by the Sun during 
                magnetic storms causes solar flares. We see these as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines 
                twist and they spin, much like a tornado would on Earth.</li>
                <li><b>The Sun generates solar wind.</b><br>The wind is a stream of charged particles. This travels 
                at approximately 450 kilometres per second through the solar system. Solar wind occurs when the 
                magnetic field of the Sun extends into space.</li>
                <li><b>Sol is the Latin for Sun</b><br>This is where the word “solar” comes from, which is used to 
                describe things that are derived from, related to, or caused by the Sun</li>
